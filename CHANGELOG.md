# Changelog — `armature-storage`

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Earlier changes are recorded in the workspace [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Adopted the `storage` criterion benchmark (file validation, metadata, local storage, uploaded-file handling) from the root package's `benches/`. Run it with `cargo bench -p armature-storage --bench storage`. The crate now sets `autobenches = false`, so a new file under `benches/` needs an explicit `[[bench]]` entry.

### Fixed

- The fully-buffered API's size ceiling is documented: every object is materialized in memory in both directions, and single-request `PutObject` caps S3 objects at 5 GiB.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Requirements on sibling armature crates name a minor instead of `0`. Under
  Cargo's 0.x rules `version = "0"` matches any release ever made, and edition
  2024 selects the MSRV-aware resolver, so a consumer declaring an older
  `rust-version` was handed the oldest version satisfying it — resolving
  `armature-core = "0"` on Rust 1.89 produced `armature-core 0.2.3` while an
  explicit `armature-core = "0.8"` elsewhere in the same graph pulled 0.8.2.
  Two copies of core, and a build failing on symbols the older one lacks. Each
  0.x minor in this family is a breaking change, so the requirement now names
  one. No API change.
